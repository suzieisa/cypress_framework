CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI)
This is a development practice where developers frequently merger their
code changes into a central repository, typically multiple times a day.
Each integration is automatically tested( BY unit tests and automated tests)
to detetct integration errors as quickly as possible. This approach reduces the
integration problems and allows a team to develop software more rapidly.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery(CD)
This practice extends the concept of Continuous Integration

Continuous deployment is a process where after the code passes the
automated tests in CI, it is automatically deployed to the production environment. This makes the deployment process entirely automated ensuring a faster and more consistent way
of getting new features and updates to the customers.

Continuous Delivery : its a slightly less aggressive approach where the deployment
to production is done manually. The process up to deployment is automated. in continuous delivery the deployment is prepapred and validated through automation, but there is a final manual step to actually move the code into production
