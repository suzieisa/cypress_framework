RECAP:
Selectors or Locators: Unique identifiers to interact with or verify web elements. 

cy.get(Selector) // find the element in a unique way 

Type of CSS Selectors
ID : fastest most reliable way to identify an element used with # (#id_value)
CLASS : it is not always unique but commonly used for elements (.class_value)
tag : not recommended, it returns multiple elements most of the time. Can be useful for h1, image, a

Attributes: very common to use after ID
[data-qa] select all the elements which have attribute called data-qa
a[data-qa] // select all the elements which are links and have attribute called data qa
a[data-qa="value"] // select all the lements which are links and have attribute called data-qa and data- qa


DYNAMIC Attributes with Dynamic elements
These are elements having dynamic attributes which change with each browser section
You can rely on these attributes even though it is id or any other attribute

SOLUTION: Attributes is dynamic (it changes) but some parts are static (doesnt change)


tag[attribute="value"] -> equals
tag[attribute*="value"] -> contains
tag[attribute^="value"] -> starts-with
tag[attribute$="value"] -> ends-with

If the attributes are completely dynamic, you cannot use *, ^, $
One option could be using visible texts as below but not best option

SOLUTION: LOCATE STABLE PARENT AND MOVE TO CHILD

direct child parentTag > childTag
descendant child parentTag child tag (space in between)

<div id="container"> 
    <span id="text-holder">
        <p id="sdhf764873">Hello World</>
    </span>
</div>

#text-holder > p // select the element which has id equals text holder and move to its direct 
#container p (NOT FOUND)

WHEN TO MOVE FROM PARENT ELEMENT TO CHILD?
1. you could not locate the element you would like to with any attribute, tags, text
2. Now you can look for the first parent and try to find it in a stable way
    If you could locate the first parent, then use it to move to the child element
3. If the first parent cannot be located as well then move up to the tree for 
upper parents
    If you could locate these parents then use it to move to the child element 
    (descendant syntax with space)

XPATH is another way to locate elements but not used commonly with Cypress or Playwright
Common to use with Selenium

The only advantage it has over CSS is that XPATH moves
