What does POM stand for? 

Page Object Model - Its a design in Sofwatre Programming
    - Makes your test files readable
    - Makes the maintenace easier

What do we hold inside the POM?

    Page specific locators and methods


In cypress how we create POM?

We create class and store locators and methods in that class
For locators, we create methods using Cypress selectors and 
return those selectores 

    Syntax:
    // MainPage.js

    class MainPage {

    getButton() {
        return cy.get("#button")
    }
    }

    export default Mainpage;

// test-1.cy.js

Have to import it to use; 
import MainPage from "../pages/Mainpage.js"


const mainPage = new MainPage () // creating a new instance here with new class
it("test block1", () => {
    mainPage.getButton().should("be.enabled")
})
it("test block2", () => {
    mainPage.getButton().should("be.visible")
})


// so if your going to use it over and over you can put it in custom commands

# Fixtures

Fixtures is a place to store our static data to read and use it as test data in
our Framework. We can read the data from JSON, csv, excel files. By implementing
the fixture in our framework, we are getting the Data-driven concept in our framework

In fixtures we can store all the test data types like expected texts, some input datas or
some expected results 

The file path of Fixture is by default defined in the config file in our tests directly using
cy.fixture method. This method gets a single argument, which represents the name 
of your file inside the fixtures folder

The file path of Fixture is by default defined in the config file, which is fixturesFolder: 'cypress/fixtures'. 

			We can access this values without importing these files in our tests directly using cy.fixture method. This method gets a single argument, which represents the name of your file inside the fixtures folder.

			Syntax:

			beforeEach(() => {
				cy.fixture('example').then(function(data) {
					this.username = data.username
				})
			})


			it('test block1', function() {
				cy.get('#username').type(this.username)
			})
Syntax: 
beforeEach(() => {
    cy.fixture("example").then(function(data)) {
    this.username = data.username
    })
})

			Sprint Types

			- 1 Week		:
			- 2 Weeks 		: {
								Devs and QA's works together in the same sprint, or QA follows the sprint 	one sprint behind.
							  }

			- 3 Weeks 		=> Devs works 2 weeks of sprint to develop the code, and they do code freeze and QA works rest of 1 week to write automation test cases.


			Scenario One:

			Sprint 1 : Devs works on the user stories (Story 1, 2, 3) and completed them.
			Sprint 1 : Qa's wait for devs to complete their code, and try to automate the functionalities in the same sprint

		    Sprint 2 : Devs works on the user stories (Story 4, 5, 6) and completed them.
			Sprint 2 : Qa's wait for devs to complete their code, and try to automate the functionalities in the same sprint

			Scenario Two(1 sprint behind):

			Sprint 1 : Devs works on the user stories (Story 1, 2, 3) and completed them.
			Sprint 1 : Qa's start writing test cases for these user stories, there is no automation.

			Sprint 2 : Devs start working on new user stories of sprint 2 (Story 4, 5, 6)
			Sprint 2 : Qa's start automation functionalities from Sprint 1 (Story 1, 2, 3)


			Scenario Three(3 weeks sprint):

			Sprint 1: In first two weeks of the sprint, Devs works on the user stories (Story 1, 2, 3) and completed them.
			Sprint 1: Qa's start automation functionalities from Sprint 1 at the last week of the sprint. (Story 1, 2, 3)



			Shift-left testing: Is a way to prepare your testing environemnt and framework before devs created their functionalities.


			Gherkin Syntax:

			Gherkin is a syntax is used to create test cases, and nowadays its mostly wide used technique to create test cases, because it makes the test case more readable.

			Keywords:

			Given 		=> Initial Step of the test case
			When 		=> Pre-condition
			Then 		=> Post-condition
			And 		=> Can be used as continious condition after When and Then


			Given the user is on https://techglobal-training.com/frontend/project-4
			Then user expected to landed in the frontend page
			When user clicks on the "Html Elements" card
			Then user expected to navigate to "Html Elements" page
			When user enters username field "TechGlobal"
			And user enters password field "Test1234"
			And user clicks on the login button
			Then user must be navigated to user page
			And user must see their username on the login page


			BDD ( Behaviour-Driven Development Testing Framework )

			BDD is a approach to create your framework in way that will help non-technical people to understand what going on. So it closes the technical gap between programmer and non-technical members ( like PO, BA, etc. )

			How ?

			Given('the user is on {string}', (url) => {
				cy.visit(url)
			})

			Then('user expected to landed in the frontend page', () => {
				cy.url().should('eq', 'techglobal')
			})
