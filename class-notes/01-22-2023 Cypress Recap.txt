# Cypress CLI

	What is the base command to run Cypress Test ?

	npx cypress run

	By default, runs the tests in Electron, and in headless. It will run all the tests you have inside inside the specPattern option in the config file.


	What are the flags to run test in different configurations ?

	* --headed					=> Runs the tests with visual browser.
	* --browser <browserType>	=> It runs the test with specific browser you defined.
	* --spec					=> Runs the specific test file.

	* --config					=> Command to overwrite any configuration option inside cypress.config
	* --env						=> Command to overwrite any option we have inside the env object in cypress.config



	What was the benefit of using CLI over Cypress GUI

		1. It has more flexibility to run our tests with different configurations
		2. CI/CD (Continious Integration & Contnious Deployment) Virtual Machine that able to build, and run your program/framework

			SOME CI/CD TOOLS

				- Jenkins
				- Spinnaker
				- Circle CI

            CI/CD tool will not understand or know how to use Cypress GUI (Cypress Runner)

            That's why we need these CLI commands to run our tests over CLI. When we configure pipelines ( run confiurations )
            for our tests, we can provide these CLI commands to tell Cypress how we want to run our tests.
